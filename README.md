### 1. Exception Handling

Understanding how to manage errors and unexpected events is crucial for robust applications. This section covers the fundamentals of checked and unchecked exceptions, and how to handle them gracefully.

-   **Notes**: [`slide11.md`](./src/slide11.md)
-   **Code Examples**:
    -   `CheckedExampleHandle.java`: Demonstrates handling compile-time exceptions.
    -   `UncheckedExample.java`: Shows how runtime exceptions occur.
    -   `ExceptionMethodsDemo.java`: Explores useful methods available in exception objects.

### 2. GUI with Swing

A look into creating desktop applications with Java's Swing toolkit. This section covers fundamental components, layout managers, and event handling.

-   **Notes**: [`slide12.md`](./src/slide12.md)
-   **Code Examples**:
    -   `SwingForm.java`: A simple form with input fields and a submit button.
    -   `SwingColorChange.java`: A basic app demonstrating event handling by changing a component's color.
    -   `SimpleSwingApp.java`: A foundational example of a Swing application.

### 3. File Handling

This section covers the basics of reading from and writing to files in Java, a fundamental skill for any application that needs to persist data.

-   **Notes**: [`slide13.md`](./src/slide13.md)
-   **Code Examples**:
    -   `FileHandlingDemo.java`: Practical examples of file I/O operations.

### 4. UML Diagrams

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the blueprint for software design. This section provides an overview of class diagrams and their notations.

-   **Notes**: [`slide14.md`](./src/slide14.md)
-   **Code Examples**:
    -   The concepts are applied in the design of the `UniversityManagementSystem` project files.

### 5. Enums

Enums provide a way to create a fixed set of constants, making code more type-safe and readable. This section explores how to use them effectively, including as a state machine.

-   **Notes**: [`slide15.md`](./src/slide15.md)
-   **Code Examples**:
    -   `Game.java`, `GameCharacter.java`, `CharacterAction.java`: A state machine implementation using enums.
    -   `PizzaOrderingSystem.java`: A practical example of using enums to represent a set of choices.

### 6. Java Streams

A brief introduction to Java Streams for processing collections of objects.

-   **Notes**: [`index.html`](./index.html)
